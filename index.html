      <p>
        A large number of the people of Bangladesh will spend tonight hungry,
        not knowing where their next meal may come from. Despite significant
        progress by efforts to reduce poverty in the area, the price of food is
        almost unaffordable to most, who do not earn enough due to rampant
        unemployment to provide for their families.

        <p>
          There are almost 40 million people suffering people in Bangladesh, one
          quarter of the people of this densely populated country, who remain
          food insecure, lacking reliable access to enough food to get by, not
          knowing where their next meal may come from.
        </p>
        <p>
          These starving people suffer each day and night in this food crisis,
          with over 5 million children suffering severe complications such as
          stunted growth and malnutrition induced by this lack of basic
          nourishment.
